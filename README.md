# HexSoftwares Basic File Encryption and Decryption

## Overview

**HexSoftwares Basic File Encryption and Decryption** is a simple and secure tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using a basic encryption algorithm. The tool is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for file protection with the added benefit of file security.

The program uses a shift-based encryption method (Caesar Cipher) to encrypt and decrypt files. The user can select a file to encrypt or decrypt and specify a shift value for the algorithm. The encrypted or decrypted file can be saved with a new name.

## Features

- **File Encryption**: Encrypt your files with a custom shift value.
- **File Decryption**: Decrypt files using the same shift value used for encryption.
- **File Selection**: Choose files to encrypt or decrypt via a file dialog.
- **Progress Indicator**: View a loading effect while processing files.
- **Error and Success Messages**: Helpful messages to guide users through the process.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: The program is written in C++ and requires a C++ compiler to build.
- **TinyFileDialogs Library**: Used for file selection dialogs.
- **Windows OS**: The program is designed to run on Windows.
